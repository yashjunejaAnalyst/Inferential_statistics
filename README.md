# Inferential_statistics
Python Project ( Inferential, Estimation, Hypothesis And Common Statistical tests )

**Project Title:**

"Statistical Inference for Decision-Making Across Sports, Manufacturing, and Healthcare Domains"

**Objective:**

To apply inferential statistical techniques such as probability estimation, hypothesis testing, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to real-world business cases in sports injury analysis, material quality control, and healthcare (dental implant hardness). The aim is to make data-driven decisions that improve operational outcomes across diverse sectors.

**Approach:**

**Problem 1- Sports Injury Analysis**

•	Computed probabilities using basic rules from contingency tables.

•	Evaluated injury likelihood based on player positions using conditional probabilities.

**Problem 2- Cement Bag Quality**

•	Applied Z-score calculations and standard normal distribution to estimate proportions of defect rates.

**Problem 3- Stone Hardness Testing**

•	Conducted one-sample t-tests to validate material suitability (H0: μ ≥ 150).

•	Compared polished vs unpolished stones using independent two-sample t-tests.

**Problem 4- Dental Implant Study (ANOVA)**

•	Performed two-way and three-way ANOVA to understand:

o	Individual effect of dentist and method

o	Joint effect of dentist × method

o	Interaction with alloy

**Outcome:**

**Key Insights by Problem-**

•	Sports Domain-

o	~62% of players had injuries.

o	Strikers and forwards are more injury-prone.

o	Conditional probabilities can help physiotherapists prioritize preventive care.

•	Manufacturing (Gunny Bags):

o	11% of bags are below safe strength (<3.17 kg/cm²).

o	13% fall in an ideal strength range (5–5.5 kg/cm²).

o	Useful for optimizing packaging standards.

•	Stone Hardness (Industrial Design):

o	Unpolished stones statistically fail the 150 hardness threshold.

o	Polished stones meet standards.

o	Significant difference in means => only polished should be accepted.

•	Healthcare (Dental Implants):

o	Both dentist and method significantly affect implant hardness.

o	Their joint effect is significant, but no three-way interaction with alloy.

o	Enables standardization and targeted training for practitioners.
